## Prerequisite

A simple server to serve HTML content like Live Server extension on VS Code.
### 👨‍💻 Installation

- Clone repository
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/femresirvan/Menuboard.git
$ cd Menuboard
```

- Start the server.

## Features
**!** There are 2 versions of menus. They are seperated by branches. Main branch contains non-interactive interface. The other(interactive) branch containts interactive interface which is includes components such as button to interact with users.

-Menu pages comes from an API folder. I use Fetch API so that you can easily integrate your own API.
-Menu pages changes with 8 seconds loops.
